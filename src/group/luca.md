PhD student from [Vincenzo Savona's](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ltpn/index-html/savona/) group at EPFL.

Joined the group for a long stay to work on Variational methods for systems driven out of equilibrium.

Became obsessed with Variational methods for dynamics, which resulted in beautiful compendium on everything you might want to know about optimizing fidelity between neural quantum states ["Neural Projected Quantum Dynamics: a systematic study" (Quantum, 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10720).
