Joined the group in April 2024 after a PhD from TUM, during which he studied frustrated spin systems.

Studied what are the key ingredients to devise effective NQS when working with spin systems ["Design principles of deep translationally-symmetric neural quantum states for frustrated magnets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03466).
