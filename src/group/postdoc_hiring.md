I'm not currently hiring a postdoc directly, however I would be happy to support strong candidates for a Marie-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship in my group.

If you have an independent research agenda and want to pursue your own research goals, yet you think our group would be a good home for you and that there could be a productive scientific interaction, do get in touch.

If I'm convinced you would be a good fit, and that your curriculum stands a chance for a fellowship, I am ready to sit down with you to ensure your application is of the highest quality.
