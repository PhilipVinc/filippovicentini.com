Joined the group in October 2023, Polytechnicien.
With a strong taste for analytics, currently working on improving variational methods to simulate quantum dynamics.

Formalised in a very elegant manner how to encode variational Manifolds, and how to write loss functions that respect the correct properties when operating on such objects ["Variational subspace methods and application to improving variational Monte Carlo dynamics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08930)
