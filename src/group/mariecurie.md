I'm looking for one (maybe two) postdocs starting in December 2025.

Candidates with a strong experience in machine learning AND/OR numerical methods for electronic structure AND/OR Variational Monte Carlo will be given priority.

Similarly, candidates knowledgeable in quantum information/tensor networks or some interesting intersections of quantum information and Machine Learning will be considered.

You will have to actively co-supervise at least one PhD student, so if you do not like working with students, you would not be a good fit.

If you think you would be a good match, do not hesitate to contact me. Please send a cv and a short commntary of your research and what you'd like to do and I will get back to you.
