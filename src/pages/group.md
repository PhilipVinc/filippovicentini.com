Our group main affiliation is to Ecole Polytechnique, but we are also affiliated to College de France where we regularly spend 2 days per week (tuesdays and fridays, though this may change in 2024).

As we felt that two affiliations were not enough, we are also in the process of being affiliated to a Project-Team at Inria Saclay.
Although that does not mean we get three salaries, it means we get a broader set of colleagues to discuss interesting problems.
