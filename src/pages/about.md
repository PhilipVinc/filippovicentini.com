## Bio

In **April 2023** I will move to Paris to start as a Tenure-Track **Assistant Professor** at the [Laboratory for Theoretical Physics](https://www.cpht.polytechnique.fr) of Ecole Polytechnique. 

In the meantime, I have been a Postdoctoral Researcher since september 2020 at the [Computational Quantum Science Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cqsl/) of **EPFL**, working closely with prolific scientist ([and twitterer...](https://twitter.com/gppcarleo)) [Prof. Giuseppe Carleo]([https://twitter.com/gppcarleo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e9I38PEAAAAJ)). In Lausanne I work on the foundations of **Neural Quantum States**; my goal is and has been to make those techniques more reliable and accessible to researchers. I have also developed several Open Source Software packages.

However, I was supposed to be at the [Center for Computational Quantum Physics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-quantum-physics/) of the **Flatiron Institute** in **New York**, but a damned virus stranded me in Paris, from where I worked remotely before going to Lausane.

Before that, I was in Paris. I defended my Ph.D. in **Theoretical Quantum Optics** in **December 2019** with a dissertaion titled "[Stochastic and Neural Network Methods for Many-Body Open Quantum Systems](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03768673/)". This was the result of 3 years of work in the [Quantum Matter and Phenomena Laboratory](https://mpq.u-paris.fr/?lang=fr) (MPQ) in Paris-Diderot University under the supervision of [Cristiano Ciuti](https://mpq.u-paris.fr/CV-of-Cristiano-Ciuti?lang=en). 
The beginning of my research focused on [Driven-Dissipative phase transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04238) of Open Quantum systems (using existing a new [numerical SDE integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08582) schemes), but towards the end of my Ph.D. I started investigating how to use [Neural-Network methods to solve Open Quantum Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10104).

Before my doctorate, I spent some time at the [Laboratoire Pierre Agrain](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu) under the supervision of [Takis Kontos](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/physique-mesoscopique/) and Matthieu Dartiailh. During that time, I fabricated, intrumented, measured and modelled some spin-based Qubits. This is the same platform behind the [C12](https://www.c12qe.com) startup, with whom I have close ties.

Before that, I lived in **Padova** (my hometown), where I studied for most of my undergraduate in Physics. The University of Padova is my alma-mater, and I loved that old, beautiful university, but eventually left to finished my studies at the Master for fundamental Physics in Paris. 

## Scientific Software

Open source software plays a fundamental role in research in general and in the development of the field of Scientific Machine Learning in particular. Easy to use, well documented software package that implements numerical methods lowers the barrier of entry to the domain, as it serves both for a practical _example_ of the math as well as a way for researchers not interested in the nitty-gritty details of computer programming to easily access those techniques.

[NetKet](https://netket.readthedocs.io) is the starting-point and the most used toolbox in the field of NQS. NetKet is a project involving [several](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711019300974) [researchers](https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhysCodeb.7) with different backgrounds, and i coordinate their contribution in such a way to grow the project. The overall aim of the NetKet project is to provide flexible implementations of most techniques published in the literature, that can be used as a starting point to perform new research.

NetKet is based on Google's [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax), a differentiable programming Python's framework. I have worked a lot with Jax since its early days, so I have developed [several extensions](https://mpi4jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). While in principle I prefer [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) to Python, Jax is very good and much better for my problem than Julia. Maybe one day I will go back to it.
