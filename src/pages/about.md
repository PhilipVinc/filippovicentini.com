## Bio

In April 2023 I will move to Paris to start as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor. 

In the meantime, I have been a Postdoctoral Researcher since september 2020 at the [Computational Quantum Science Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cqsl/) of EPFL, working closely with prolific twitterer Prof. [Giuseppe Carleo](https://twitter.com/gppcarleo).
In Lausanne I work on the foundations of Neural Quantum States; my goal is and has been to make those techniques more reliable and accessible to researchers.

However, I was supposed to be at the [Center for Computational Quantum Physics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-quantum-physics/) of the Flatiron Institute in New York, but a damn virus stranded me in Paris, from where I worked remotely before going to Lausane.

Before that, I was in Paris. I defended my Ph.D. in Theoretical Quantum Optics in December 2019 with a dissertaion titled "[Stochastic and Neural Network Methods for Many-Body Open Quantum Systems](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03768673/)". This was the result of 3 years of work in the [Quantum Matter and Phenomena Laboratory](https://mpq.u-paris.fr/?lang=fr) (MPQ) in Paris-Diderot University under the supervision of [Cristiano Ciuti](https://mpq.u-paris.fr/CV-of-Cristiano-Ciuti?lang=en). 
The beginning of my research focused on [Driven-Dissipative phase transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04238) of Open Quantum systems (using existing a new [numerical SDE integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08582) schemes), but towards the end of my Ph.D. I started investigating how to use [Neural-Network methods to solve Open Quantum Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10104).

Before my doctorate, I spent some time at the [Laboratoire Pierre Agrain](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu) under the supervision of [Takis Kontos](https://www.lpens.ens.psl.eu/physique-mesoscopique/) and Matthieu Dartiailh. During that time, I fabricated, intrumented, measured and modelled some spin-based Qubits. This is the same platform behind the [C12](https://www.c12qe.com) startup, with whom I have close ties.

Before that, I lived in Padova (my hometown), where I studied for most of my undergraduate in Physics. I loved that old, beautiful university, but eventually left to finished my studies at the Master for fundamental Physics in Paris.
