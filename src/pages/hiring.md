(Last update: September 2025)

The core of the group is now composed by me, 2 PostDocs, 4 PhD students and some long-term Master interns.
The group is officially based at the Theoretical Physics Laboratory (CPhT) of Ecole Polytechnique, but we spend considerable time at College de France in the center of Paris.
If you are interested in any position below, contact me at my email address `name.surname@polytechnique.edu`.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

I am looking for **Postdocs** to work on algorithms and applications of Neural Quantum States to work on the following projects:
  - Variational Methods for electronic structure problems (mainly foundation models & dynamics)
  - Combining variational methods with data coming from experimental setups
  - crazy, great ideas

I am looking for profiles with considerable prior experience in numerical physics. 
A strong background in Machine Learning is a strong plus. 
Knowledge of Neural Quantum States is not a requirement, but you should be knowledgeable in an area such as Variational Methods, quantum information, numerical methods for electronic structure, ML4Quantum or similar.
A taste for quantum algorithms and quantum computing is appreciated.
Spontaneous applications are encouraged.

## PhD students

**PhD applications** If you want to do your PhD in our group starting in fall 2025, contact me between September and January 2024. 
In general, as I find an interesting person that I would like to work with for the next 3 years, I will commit to that person and won't hire more for that year. 
This means that the earlier you contact me, the better. In general the PhD candidacy exam to which you should apply is for students from Ecole Polytechnique in February, and for externals in April.
This means that you should contact me before february otherwise I might already be supporting an internal candidate.

## Master students

I do not take on **Master students** for short internships (less than four months).
I consider applications for **Master students** with prior experience in Machine Learning and/or Computational Physics for a long internship (6 months). 

 - Students in the french academic system must apply 3-6 months in advance (usually between late september and late november for internships starting in january).
 - International students should apply 6 months in advance and have a plan for applying to an exchange program through an official international mobility program (Erasmus or similar).
 - Due to agreements between universities, EPFL/ETH students (as well as DTU/TUM/TUe) can apply at any moment, however late applications might be rejected because of limited supervision bandwith. 
 - If you want to do a joint project on Quantum and Classical Computing, with a startup, let me know. The same rules as above apply.
