The core of the group is now composed by me, two PhD students and some long-term Master interns. 
The group is based at the Theoretical Physics Laboratory (CPhT) of Ecole Polytechnique.

I am looking for **one Postdoc** to work on algorithms and applications of Neural Quantum States to start in **Early 2024** (date flexible) to work on my recently funded ANR project **Neural dynamics for Quantum Matter**. 
I am looking for profiles with prior experience in Machine Learning, ideally Neural Quantum States and/or experience on quantum information and/or numerical methods for fermionic systems.
If you have worked with Path integral methods in the past that's a plus.
I will open an official call soon, but spontaneous applications are encouraged.

I am not looking for Phd students at the moment or **Master students** for short internships (less than four months).
I might consider **Master students** with prior experience in Machine Learning and/or Computational Physics for a long internship (6 months) starting in **spring 2024**.
In the case of international students, the exchange should be funded through an official international mobility program (Erasmus or similar).

If you are interested, contact me at my email address `name.surname@polytechnique.edu`.
