The core of the group is now composed by me, a PostDoc, two PhD students and some long-term Master interns. 
The group is based at the Theoretical Physics Laboratory (CPhT) of Ecole Polytechnique.

I am looking for **one senior Postdoc** to work on algorithms and applications of Neural Quantum States to work on my recently funded ANR project **Neural dynamics for Quantum Matter**. 
I am looking for profiles with prior experience in Machine Learning, ideally Neural Quantum States and/or experience on quantum information and/or numerical methods for fermionic systems.
If you have worked with Path integral methods in the past that's a plus.
A taste for quantum algorithms and quantum computing is appreciated.
Spontaneous applications are encouraged.

**PhD applications** to start in fall 2024 are closed. For a PhD starting in fall 2025, contact me in September 2024.

I do not take on **Master students** for short internships (less than four months).
I consider applications for **Master students** with prior experience in Machine Learning and/or Computational Physics for a long internship (6 months). 

 - Students in the french academic system must apply 3-6 months in advance (usually between late september and late november for internships starting in january).
 - International students should apply 6 months in advance and have a plan for applying to an exchange program through an official international mobility program (Erasmus or similar).
 - Due to agreements between universities, EPFL/ETH students (as well as DTU/TUM/TUe) can apply at any moment, however late applications might be rejected because of limited supervision bandwith. 
 - If you want to do a joint project on Quantum and Classical Computing, with a startup, let me know. The same rules as above apply.

If you are interested, contact me at my email address `name.surname@polytechnique.edu`.
