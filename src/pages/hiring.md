(Last update: June 2024)

The core of the group is now composed by me, a PostDoc, two PhD students and some long-term Master interns.
Another PhD student and Postdoc will be joining the group in October 2024.
The group is based at the Theoretical Physics Laboratory (CPhT) of Ecole Polytechnique.
If you are interested in any position below, contact me at my email address `name.surname@polytechnique.edu`.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

~~I am looking for **one senior Postdoc** to work on algorithms and applications of Neural Quantum States to work on my recently funded ANR project **Neural dynamics for Quantum Matter**.
I am looking for profiles with prior experience in Machine Learning, ideally Neural Quantum States and/or experience on quantum information and/or numerical methods for fermionic systems.
If you have worked with Path integral methods in the past that's a plus.
A taste for quantum algorithms and quantum computing is appreciated.
Spontaneous applications are encouraged.~~

The position mentioned above has been filled in June 2024.
I'm not actively recruiting anyone at the moment, however I will support strong candidates applying for a [Marie Sklodowska Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) in my group.

## PhD students

**PhD applications** If you want to do your PhD in our group starting in fall 2025, contact me between September and January 2024. 
In general, as I find an interesting person that I would like to work with for the next 3 years, I will commit to that person and won't hire more for that year. 
This means that the earlier you contact me, the better. In general the PhD candidacy exam to which you should apply is for students from Ecole Polytechnique in February, and for externals in April.
This means that you should contact me before february otherwise I might already be supporting an internal candidate.

## Master students

I do not take on **Master students** for short internships (less than four months).
I consider applications for **Master students** with prior experience in Machine Learning and/or Computational Physics for a long internship (6 months). 

 - Students in the french academic system must apply 3-6 months in advance (usually between late september and late november for internships starting in january).
 - International students should apply 6 months in advance and have a plan for applying to an exchange program through an official international mobility program (Erasmus or similar).
 - Due to agreements between universities, EPFL/ETH students (as well as DTU/TUM/TUe) can apply at any moment, however late applications might be rejected because of limited supervision bandwith. 
 - If you want to do a joint project on Quantum and Classical Computing, with a startup, let me know. The same rules as above apply.
