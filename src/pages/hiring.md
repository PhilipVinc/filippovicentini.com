I am looking for **prospective Ph.D. students** to work on algorithms and applications of Neural Quantum States to start in **Fall 2023** (ideally September). 
I am also looking for **Master students** for internships **starting April 2022**, to be based between Ecole Polytechnique and [Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr).

If you are interested, contact me with the form you find [here](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en/directory/vicentini-filippo) or at my email address `name.surname@polytechnique.edu`.
